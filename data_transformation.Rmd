## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
# First data transformation function
transform_data <- function(data) {
    # Transform the data, e.g., calculate the mean of each column
    result <- sapply(data, function(x) if(is.numeric(x)) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) else NA)
    return(result)
}

# Test with built-in dataset 'mtcars'
transform_data(mtcars)

```{r}
# Second data transformation function
filter_data <- function(data_new) {
    # Keep only rows where mpg is greater than 20
    result <- subset(data, mpg > 20)
    return(result)
}

# Test the second function
filter_data(mtcars)

```

## Including Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
